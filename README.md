# Pastor-Daves-Slob-On-My-Knob
Audio Plugin for Windows by: David Mann Jr.

Probably won't compile unless you install the wdl-ol framework. I used an external library to compile.

To access the .dll files for use, go to the location:
-----------------------------------------------------
Pastor-Daves-Slob-On-My-Knob/build-win/vst2/x64/bin/

The .dll file should be in that folder. Copy to your VST directory!
